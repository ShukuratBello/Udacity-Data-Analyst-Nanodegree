# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree - Data Analysis with Python
This repository contains projects for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree completed  in 2022

**key learnings** from the course:
- Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data, and work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- Apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
- Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data and use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
- Apply visualization principles to the data analysis process and explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

## Listed below are some of the projects completed during the training period:

## Data Extraction and Wrangling - (We Rate Dogs Dataset)

Subjects Covered:
* GATHERING DATA: 
   * Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
   * Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
   * Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
* ASSESSING DATA 
   * Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
   * Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
   * Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
* CLEANING DATA 
   * Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
   * Clean data using Python and pandas
   * Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python

##  Data Visualisation
Subjects Covered:
* Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales ) 
* Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
* Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices , feature enginnering )
* Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data ,  polish plots , create slide deck ) 


## Communicate data finding with Ford GoBike Sharing Analysis.
In this project, I used Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for
its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
